This project focuses on developing a hand gesture recognition model capable of accurately identifying and classifying various hand gestures from image or video data. The goal is to enable intuitive human-computer interaction and gesture-based control systems. The model will be trained on a dataset containing images or video frames of different hand gestures, such as thumbs up, peace sign, pointing, etc. Advanced deep learning techniques, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs), may be employed to extract meaningful features from the hand gesture images. The trained model will then be capable of recognizing and classifying unseen hand gestures with high accuracy, facilitating seamless interaction between users and devices through intuitive gestures.
